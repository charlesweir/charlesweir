- Hi, I'm Charles Weir. I work as a researcher at Lancaster University, UK

Most of my projects here are stuff related to the needs of a researcher, but will also have other applications. I'm particularly pleased with WordImagesAndTables, which I 
use all the time myself when writing Word documents.

There's more about me and further links at https://charlesweir.com
